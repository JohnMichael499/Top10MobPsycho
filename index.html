	<h1>10. DIMPLE</h1>
    	<div id="div1" class="container">
	</div>
	<p> Dimple is far more powerful when fans first meet him, but Mob nearly exorcises him and drains the majority of his energy during the first season of Mob Psycho 100. That said, he sticks around in his much weaker form, eventually becoming a companion to Mob — and as much as Dimple says he's just waiting for the right moment to steal Mob's body, it's clear that he starts to care about the kid.</p>
	<div id="div1.1" class="container">
	</div>
	<h1>9. Ritsu Kageyama</h1>
	<div id="div2" class="container">
	</div>
	<p>When fans first meet Ritsu, he's introduced as Mob's younger brother who doesn't have the same telekinetic abilities that Mob possesses. For a while, it seems as though Ritsu resents his big brother for his powers — but then the series reveals that Ritsu actually has powers of his own, even if they're inferior to Mob's. Initially, Ritsu's powers are incredibly tame in comparison to most of the other espers we meet. Over time, however, Ritsu's abilities increase and he becomes stronger. And unfortunately, unlike Mob, Ritsu doesn't fault espers for using their powers against other human beings when it's necessary.</p>
	<div id="div2.2" class="container">
	</div>
	<h1>8. Teruki Hanazawa</h1>
	<div id="div3" class="container">
	</div>
	<p>Teruki Hanazawa kicks off his tenure on Mob Psycho 100 by challenging Mob to a battle, during which both characters showcase what they can do with their telekinetic abilities. And to be fair, Teruki holds his own against Mob pretty well, despite being far less intimidating at the height of his abilities than Mob is at his strongest. Teruki's also able to stand up to some of the more talented members of Claw, proving that he's more than just a kid with minor abilities. One thing that often holds Teruki back, though, is the fact that he freezes up when he loses a fight, becoming sick and unable to channel his powers for some time afterward. If it weren't for this shortcoming, Teruki might even fall higher on this list.</p>
	<div id="div3.3" class="container">
	</div>
	<h1>7. Toshiki Minegichi</h1>
	<div id="div4" class="container">
	</div>
	<p> Toshiki Minegichi is one of the more powerful espers we meet, and they're wrapped up in the schemes of the criminal oganization Claw when fans are first introduced to them. In fact, Minegichi is part of the Ultimate 5, a group comprised of the five most elite members of Claw, all of whom are counted as exceptional when it comes to using psychic abilities. Minegichi has a unique power that allows them to create and control plantlife. And while this doesn't necessarily sound menacing, Minegichi proves quite a challenge when producing vines and Venus flytraps, both of which they set on their opponents. The downside of this strength is that it can also be turned against Minegichi by a stronger psychic; if someone else takes control of the plants, that person can turn them against Minegichi and anyone else they choose to attack.</p>
	<div id="div4.4" class="container">
	</div>
	<h1>6. Sho Suzuki</h1>
	<div id="div5" class="container">
	</div>
	<p>Considering that Sho is the son of Claw's leader, it's really no surprise that he's capable of achieving some pretty powerful feats using his abilities. Even if he resists his father's plans and teachings, Sho's been raised in a world that emphasizes strengthening one's psychic powers — and if his are anything to judge by, that environment has served him fairly well. ho has an impressive range of abilities, many of which viewers see him use over the course of the series. Not only can he use telekinesis like Mob can, but he can bend light to his will, allowing him to appear invisible if he desires. Sho can also store energy like his father can, allowing him to build his power steadily and unleash it all at once.</p>
	<div id="div5.5" class="container">
	</div>
	<h1>5. Ryo Shimazaki</h1>
	<div id="div6" class="container">
	</div>	
	<p>Ryo Shimazaki is another member of Claw's Ultimate 5, and he creates quite a problem for Mob's friends when Claw decides to take control of their city. Shimazaki proves himself capable of defeating Teruki and Ritsu in combat, and it's only when the group distracts him that they're able to find a way to stop his destruction. One of Shimazaki's greatest strengths is his ability to teleport, something he uses to kidnap the Prime Minister and defeat his opponents — at least until Teruki catches on to the repetitive ways Shimazaki utilizes his powers. Shimazaki can also use his "Mind's Eye" to sense other espers, gaining an advantage on other psychics who might attempt to sneak up on him.</p>
	<div id="div6.6" class="container">
	</div>
	<h1>4. Katsuya Serizawa</h1>
	<div id="div7" class="container">
	</div>
	<p>Katsuya Serizawa is also a part of the Ultimate 5 and a member of Claw when fans meet him, although Mob does convince him to leave Claw and lead a less destructive life near the end of the show's second season. Serizawa initially joined Claw after living a sheltered existence indoors, terrified of his own powers. Toichiro coaxed him out of his solitude and persuaded him to use his abilities to serve him, but Serizawa believed Toichiro actually had his best interests at heart. And Serizawa does have some impressively strong powers, so it's understandable that Toichiro would recruit him. He's capable of using psychokinesis, which oddly enough, he channels through his umbrella. As ridiculous as it is, it's dangerous when leveled at an opponent, and it provides adequate protection when used as a shield. In fact, Serizawa would have proved a challenge for Mob to defeat in an actual fight, so it's probably a good then Mob was able to talk him down instead.</p>
	<div id="div7.7" class="container">
	</div>
	<h1>3. Keiji Mogami</h1>
	<div id="div8" class="container">
	</div>
	<p>Mob Psycho 100 fans first meet Keiji Mogami as an evil spirit, but they soon learn that Mogami was actually one of the most powerful psychics to ever live prior to his death. In fact, he was formerly known as "The Greatest Psychic of the 20th Century," a title that speaks volumes about the sort of power he's capable of wielding.

	<h1>2. Toichiro Suzuki</h1>
	<div id="div9" class="container">
	</div>
	<p>Most of the espers on Mob Psycho 100 are far beneath Mob in terms of power, but Toichiro presents one of the first real threats to the boy. The leader of the criminal organization claw, Toichiro has plenty of other espers at his disposal — and during his confrontation with Mob, he admits being able to absorb the powers of his followers. Like Sho, he can store psychic energy and unleash it at his discretion. Toichiro can also take things one step further, however, and transfer his abilities to other people — even those who aren't espers to begin with. In this way, he could summon an army to his disposal if he wished. Toichiro's also capable of sending shock waves through his opponents, creating shielded barriers to protect him from things like Reigen's bullets, and even manipulate gravity. He's definitely a formidable villain, even for Mob to contend with.</p>
	<div id="div9.9" class="container">
	</div>
	<h1>1. Shigeo "Mob" Kageyama</h1>
	<div id="div10" class="container">
	</div>
	<p>Mob has proven time and time again that he's the most powerful character on Mob Psycho 100, having defeated all of the characters listed here on at least one occasion. Mob's telekinetic powers are unusually strong for someone his age, and his ability to sense and exorcise evil spirits is on another level. And as Mob's meter climbs from 1 percent to 100 percent — and sometimes beyond that — he only becomes more difficult to defeat. Even though Toichiro put up a good fight against him, there are few people who can challenge him when his suppressed psychic energy rises to the surface, bringing him to ???% mode on his meter. It's a truly fortunate thing that Mob uses his powers for good instead of evil.</p>
